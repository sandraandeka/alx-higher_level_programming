  * not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
  * have to use the variables str1 and str2 in your new line of code
  * program should be exactly 5 lines long

**[7-edges.py](7-edges.py)** - Complete the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/7-edges.py) such that:
  * `word_first_3` contains the first 3 letters of the variable `word`
  * `word_last_2` contains the last 2 letters of the variable `word`
  * `middle_word` contains the value of the variable `word` without the first and last letters
  * not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
  * program should be exactly 8 lines long

**[8-concat_edges.py](8-concat_edges.py)** - Complete the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/8-concat_edges.py) in order to print `object-oriented programming with Python`, followed by a new line.
  * not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
  * program should be exactly 5 lines long
  * not allowed to create new variables
  * not allowed to use string literals

**[9-easter_egg.py](9-easter_egg.py)** - Write a Python script that prints "The Zen of Python", by TimPeters, followed by a new line.
  * script should be maximum 98 characters long

### Advanced
**[100-write.py](100-write.py)** - Write a Python script that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line.
  * Use the function `write` from the `sys` module
  * not allowed to use `print`
  * script should print to `stderr`
  * script should exit with the status code `1`

**[101-compile](101-compile)** - Write a script that compiles a Python script file. The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable `$PYFILE`. The output filename has to be `$PYFILEc` (ex: `export PYFILE=my_main.py` => output filename: `my_main.pyc`)

**[102-magic_calculation.py](102-magic_calculation.py)** - Write a Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b):` that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
```
 3		0 LOAD_CONST               1 (98)
              	3 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
